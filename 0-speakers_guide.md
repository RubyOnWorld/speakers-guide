# RustFest speakers guide

Hi fellow human! You are receiving this document because you are speaking at RustFest.
We are happy to have you on stage!

Before we start: this is a guide, and while I will talk about recommended
speech patterns, this is not a strict ruleset to follow. You know yourself
best. As long as you are not violating the Code of Conduct, the worst that
can happen to you is feedback.

This document is here to help you in your preparation of your talk. Please
note that it is for everyone. Because we have experienced and beginner
speakers, the document is divided in sections.

* [Must-knows](1-must.md): The must read. It holds all the technical
  information and some particularities about our conference.
* [Audience](2-audience.md): A description of the audience at the conference.
* [Ableism](3-ableism.md): RustFest does have a focus on being an
  accessible conference for people with disabilities and ableism is an
  often-forgotten topic when speaking to them. You should probably read this.
* [Beginners](4-beginners.md): Many words for beginners. If you are
  experienced, you may or may not want to read this, too, but you are not the
  focus group of this.
* [Schedule](5-schedule.md): Have a look at the provisional schedule. Let
  us know if there are any issues.
* [Travel Info](6-travel.md): If you stay at the speakers hotel, please
  read through this.


If you have never given a talk at a conference before, please follow the
instructions on what happens on the day exactly, to decrease stress
and increase happiness.

You will additionally receive a running list for the day shortly before the
conference.
