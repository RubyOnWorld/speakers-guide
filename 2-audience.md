## Audience

*Beginners note:* knowing your audience is important! A talk in front of a
specialist audience is entirely different from a talk in front of a generalist
audience. Different audiences need different content. A joke that is fun in one
room is not fun in another and the other way around.

RustFest is a community conference about the Rust programming language, which
is relatively young, but has gathered some attention. It has especially found a
way to engage new people in systems programming. Assume the audience to be a
mix of experienced systems programmers and fresh people and try to cater to
both. We also hope for a rather diverse audience and the tech communities we interact with
tend to take diversity seriously (more on that later).

Be aware that many attendees will have an acceptable level of English skills,
but will not have English as a first language. Thus you may consider avoiding
the use of English idioms (e.g. "pull somebody's leg") as they may create
confusion.

Rust is a new programming language building on foundations and ideas from many
that came before.
As such, there will probably be no one in the audience that has Rust as a first
language. Please keep that in mind. Also see the section about jokes in the
beginners guide if you have the feeling that these might go awry.

RustFest takes pride in being a conference that cares for people with
disabilities and mental health issues. Please help us in making sure they feel
welcome. See the [section about ableist speech](3-ableism.md).
