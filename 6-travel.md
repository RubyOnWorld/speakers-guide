## Getting around

Berlin has a good and safe subway system that runs all night. Make sure you
check travel times for subways before heading home at night, it's often far
cheaper then hailing a cab. If you plan to use the system rather often, it
makes sense to buy a weekend ticket.

Cabs are state-sanctioned and of high quality.

## Cash

Paying with credit-cards in small shops or the supermarket is unusual in
Germany. Sometimes, such as in cabs, there's a hefty fee on it. Always carry
some cash around.

Weirdly, ATMs are not as common in Berlin as you might expect, so don't rely on
finding one "on the way" if you are in a hurry. Check Google Maps.

Dollars are not accepted in Germany.

## Shops and Sundays

Most shops outside of train stations are closed on Sundays. Plan accordingly.

If you need something urgent, travel to the next train station, Alexanderplatz
or Friedrichsstra√üe.

## Safety

Note that walking around the street at night is safe, especially in the middle
of town where you are going to stay. If you feel unsafe in cities, sticking in
a group together with a local is still recommendable. Feel free to ask team
members or local community members if the have time to spend the evening with
you.

Public transportation is safe and frequently used at night by everyone. Berlin
is the city with the lowest car ownership in Germany.

For detailed safety information, also about interactions with the police or
racism, [WikiTravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Germany#Stay_safe) has a good
writeup.

Also, feel free to ask the local organisers about their recommendations if you
want.

## Emergency numbers

In case of emergencies of _any_ kind, dial 112 on your phone. This connects you
to a service connecting you to firefighters, paramedics and the police.

You can also dial 110 for the police directly.
